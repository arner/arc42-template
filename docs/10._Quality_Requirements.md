# 10. Quality Requirements 

This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with
scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in
section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.


## 10.1. Quality Tree

The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis
Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

## 10.2. Quality Scenarios

Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements
using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at
the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

-   Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case
    scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain
    stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s
    efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s
    request within one second.

-   Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its
    immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is
    implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.
