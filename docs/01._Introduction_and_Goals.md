# 1. Introduction and Goals

Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software
architects and development team must consider. These include

-   underlying business goals, essential features and functional
    requirements for the system

-   quality goals for the architecture

-   relevant stakeholders and their expectations

## 1.1. Requirements Overview

Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces,
extract (or abstract) of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing)
requirements documents (with version number and information where to
find it).

## 1.2. Quality Goals

The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose
fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We
really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with
project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

## 1.3. Stakeholders

Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles
or organizations that

-   should know the architecture

-   have to be convinced of the architecture

-   have to work with the architecture or with code

-   need the documentation of the architecture for their work

-   have to come up with decisions about the system or its development
