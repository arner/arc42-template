# 3. System Scope and Context

System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system
(i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners (neighboring
systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby
specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs
and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

## 3.1 Business Context

Specification of **all** communication partners (users, IT-systems, â€¦)
with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication
protocols.

## 3.2 Technical Context

Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your
system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific
input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which
channel.
