# 6. Runtime View

The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the
systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

- important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute
  them?

- interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks
  cooperate with users and neighboring systems?

- operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop

- error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios
(sequences, workflows) is their **architectural relevance**. It is
**not** important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should
rather document a representative selection.
